## Anforderungen

- all handouts, slides and code must be present in the forum sorted into the correct place
- put into calendar entry of your e-Portfolio
  Slides
  - Tutorial (this equates to the typical readme.md that you see on good git projects that tell people what your code does and how to get started using it)
  - Example Code for your demo
  - Sort this entry into the correct forum topic

## Grading criteria

- Email before presentation
  - Make sure to email your class about anything that needs to be installed BEFORE coming (this is part of your grade so dont forget to CC me in your email!!! and put all the info into the forum!)
  - EVEN if people do not NEED to install anything, email before in case others might decide to prepare for your presentations. So in other words, all e-Portfolios require an email.
- presentation
  - at least 30 minutes
  - (a couple of slides theory + THEN HANDS-ON-Experience for all.
  - Keep the theory short (5-10min)
  - Hands-on can also take longer and often this is not a problem when people want to learn this material
  - People can come and ask you afterwards if they need more information.
- topic Relates to course needs
- Entry in forum correctly done
- Components:
  - Sample code
  - in class demo
  - slides
  - tutorial written by you
- Some topics do not include code (RUP or Scrum) but they still need to include a demo using a tool that you choose to present.
- Be aware: I can ask you to resubmit the Forum entry to improve the quality or make it complete
